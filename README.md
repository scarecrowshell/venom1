# Venom Core

## Core Idea

Venom1 functions as a distributed, policy-enforced sensor fusion and event attestation subsystem designed to ingest heterogeneous, real-time telemetry from geospatially dispersed sources—including electro-optical, thermal, acoustic, radio-frequency, and open-source intelligence feeds—and collapse them into a temporally aligned, hierarchically structured, and cryptographically verifiable stream of canonical observables. It applies a role-based access control matrix with classification ceilings at the point of ingestion, ensuring that downstream computational processes receive only authorized, schema-conformant representations of environmental state. The system maintains an append-only, machine-readable audit ledger of all visibility decisions and derived alerts, thereby establishing a non-repudiable chain of perceptual provenance that enables deterministic replay, forensic reconstruction, and gated promotion of autonomous behaviors based on empirically validated situational ground truth.

## Constituent Subsystems

- Global Surveillance Feed
- Interior Mapping Scanner
- Thermal Imaging Analyzer
- Crowd Density Estimator

## Comprehensive Capabilities

- Multi-source telemetry ingestion and unification (CCTV, public cameras, OSINT streams, IoT sensors, satellite downlinks)
- Canonical event schema enforcement with geospatial hierarchy (region, country, city, location)
- UTC ISO8601 timestamp alignment across all ingested data streams
- Role-based access control with configurable source allow-lists and classification ceilings (public, internal, secret)
- Policy-driven visibility filtering applied pre-processing to prevent unauthorized data exposure
- Configurable threshold-based alert generation for motion scores, crowd density, keyword bursts, and gunshot events
- Severity-ranked alert prioritization (low, medium, high, critical)
- Spatio-temporal correlation of alerts occurring within defined time windows at identical locations
- Hierarchical region-to-location rollup views for situational overview
- Unified chronological timeline presentation of all visible events
- Immutable JSONL audit logging of all policy decisions, session boundaries, alert generation, and correlations
- Automated asset discovery and fingerprinting across network segments
- Physical environment modeling via ingestion of floor plans, BIM data, and geospatial annotations
- Real-time thermal signature analysis with anomaly detection against established baselines
- Computer vision-based crowd density estimation and flow pattern analysis from video feeds
- Behavioral pattern extraction and deviation tracking from observed entity movements and interactions
- Deterministic session replay capability via audit log and event store
- Telemetry export interface for downstream consumption by platform Telemetry Core
